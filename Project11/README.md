Following along with 100 Days of Swift by HackingWithSwift.com https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

This is days 45 - 47 and involves creating my first Sprite Kit game of the series

Skills include:
- Sprite Kit
- SKSpriteNode
- Asset catalogue
- z position
- image blend mode
- touches began
- SKPhysicsBody (edgeLoop, Rect, Radius)
- isDynamic
- restitution
- SKAction spin
- SKAction repeat forever
- contactTestBitMask
- collisionBitMask
- SKPhysicsContactDelegate
- SKPhysicsContact
- SKSpriteNode names
- SKNode
- remove node from parent
- SKLabelNode
- SKEmitterNode
- Radians


Challenges completed with my own code are:
- A random ball color is spawned each time the screen is tapped
- Forcing the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen
- Ball count label
- Imposing a limit of five balls
- Obstacle boxes removed when they are hit
- Landing in a green slot gives an additional ball
