# 100DoS-project10

Following along with 100 Days of Swift by HackingWithSwift.com https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

This was days 42 - 44 and involved creating an image storing app to help remember people's names.

Skills include:
- UICollectionView
- custom UICollectionViewCell
- UIImagePickerController
- embed in NavigationController
- NavigationItem
- @objc functions
- #selector
- UIImagePickerControllerDelegate
- UINavigationControllerDelegate
- optional typcasting
- UUID
- JpegData
- write information to disk (private documents)
- NSObject inheritance
- initialisers
- UIAlertController with textbox
- trailing closure syntax

Challenges completed with my own code are:
- add alert controller to allow user to pick whether to rename or delete when cell is selected
- if name has previously been added, put that name as the placeholder text when editing
- allowing the user to take a picture rather than selecting from camera roll
