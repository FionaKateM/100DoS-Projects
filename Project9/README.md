# 100DoS-project9


Following along with 100 Days of Swift by HackingWithSwift.com https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100

This was days 39 - 40 and involved editing the web browser I created in project 7.

Skills include:
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)
- Fixing a blocking call
- threads 
- QoS queues (default, user interactive, user initiated, utility, background)
- Moving between threads
- Multithreading
- async()
- closures
- Perform Selector in background

Challenges completed with my own code are:
- Modify the project so that your filtering code takes place in the background. 
- Filtering does nothing if keyword is empty
